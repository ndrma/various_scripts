This contains scripts (written in python) that have proved useful during investigations I've been a part of.
More info per folder, list below.

- ADS-B Exchange .kml to .csv
- scraper for php site: https://keraies.eett.gr/anazhthsh.php | could reasonably be adjusted for any similar site
- automated monitor screenshot and mouse movement (this is not headless)
- .csv camera data to blender

The scripts are as-is and likely to require some level of customization to make them work in your specific circumstance but the functionality is there.
